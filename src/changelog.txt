Implemented:
    4.4.2018
    Assess functions in bag for a different implementation
        occurrences()
            Similar to the implementation observed from another student.
        Debug::fmt() <generic>
            All for nawt until I found the for_each() iterator function.
        Add::add()
            Couldnt use iterators but the code is nicer none the less.
        AddAssign::add_assign()
            I considered using what I used in Add::add()
                but I believe my existing code is more efficient.
        PartialEq::eq()
            I used the built in slice eq trait, making it much simpler.
        trim_to_size
            A small expression change.
        erase_one
            Used iterators and pattern matching
        varius methods for reference parameters
            Parameters that are copyable, like usize, were left as non references.

    Added Clone::clone_from() method for completeness

In_Combat:
    <None>

Planned:
    Restructure of bagexam.rs to fit more of a testing implementation
    Make a f64 bag

Abandonded:
    Assess functions in bag for a different implementation
        erase
            Not only a problem in efficientcy, but also a problem of iterative implementation
